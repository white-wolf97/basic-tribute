					<p>
						Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling,
						acclaimed writer-director Christopher Nolan was born on July 30,
						1970, in London, England. Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking,
						Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some
						of the biggest blockbusters ever made.
					</p>
					<p>
						At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's
						Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University
						College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film
						society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later
						use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of
						around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of
						international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and
						gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather
						substantial financing for his next film.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nolan's second film was Memento (2000), which he directed from his
						own screenplay based on a short story by his brother Jonathan.
						Starring Guy Pearce, the film brought Nolan numerous honors,
						including Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best
						Original Screenplay. Nolan went on to direct the critically
						acclaimed psychological thriller, Insomnia (2002), starring Al
						Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.
					</p>
					<p>
						The turning point in Nolan's career occurred when he was awarded the
						chance to revive the Batman franchise in 2005. In Batman Begins
						(2005), Nolan brought a level of gravitas back to the iconic hero,
						and his gritty, modern interpretation was greeted with praise from
						fans and critics alike. Before moving on to a Batman sequel, Nolan
						directed, co-wrote, and produced the mystery thriller The Prestige
						(2006), starring Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as magicians whose
						obsessive rivalry leads to tragedy and murder.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2008, Nolan directed, co-wrote, and produced The Dark Knight
						(2008) which went on to gross more than a billion dollars at the
						worldwide box office. Nolan was nominated for a Directors Guild of
						America (D.G.A.) Award, Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) Award and
						Producers Guild of America (P.G.A.) Award, and the film also
						received eight Academy Award nominations.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2010, Nolan captivated audiences with the sci-fi thriller
						Inception (2010), which he directed and produced from his own
						original screenplay. The thought-provoking drama was a worldwide
						blockbuster, earning more than $800,000,000 and becoming one of the
						most discussed and debated films of the year. Among its many honors,
						Inception received four Academy Awards and eight nominations,
						including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Nolan was recognized by
						his peers with D.G.A. and P.G.A. Award nominations, as well as a
						W.G.A. Award for his work on the film.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the best-reviewed and highest-grossing movies of 2012, The
						Dark Knight Rises (2012) concluded Nolan's Batman trilogy. Due to
						his success rebooting the Batman character, Warner Bros. enlisted
						Nolan to produce their revamped Superman movie Man of Steel (2013),
						which opened in the summer of 2013. In 2014, Nolan directed, wrote,
						and produced the science-fiction epic Interstellar (2014), starring
						Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain. Paramount
						Pictures and Warner Bros. released the film on November 5, 2014, to
						positive reviews and strong box-office results, grossing over $670
						million dollars worldwide.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nolan resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, producer
						Emma Thomas, and their children. Nolan and Thomas also have their
						own production company, Syncopy.
